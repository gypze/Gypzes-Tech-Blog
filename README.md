# Tech Blog

Welcome to Gypze's Tech Blog—a platform designed for developers to share their ideas, experiences, and insights into the world of technology. Whether you're documenting your journey as a programmer, writing tutorials, or expressing your thoughts on the latest tech trends, this blog empowers you to connect with the developer community.

This CMS-style blog was built from the ground up with a focus on simplicity and user experience. It provides features such as user authentication, the ability to create and edit posts, and the option to leave comments on other developers' posts. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and incorporates modern web development tools like Handlebars.js, Sequelize, and Express.js.

With a unique blend of creativity and determination, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the developer community. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games, enjoying heavy metal music, or spending time with my cats. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
